Control-able Device to add List
	Servos
	LEDs
	Audio
	
Control Device Drivers to Add
	Beagle Board Black
	

Use Preference File format instead of text file for defining devices and control units



Issues:
	Seems that there is a communication issue where the java servlet is waiting for an I/O response from the arduino. May have been fixed by adding a time-out, but need to be aware.


May Arduino aware when the serial monitor is disconnected and to reset. 


Android APP:
	Make modular.
		For example allow the user to arrange controls
		Add/remove specific motors/servos/leds
		Receive preference file from the control unit.
	Multi-page.
